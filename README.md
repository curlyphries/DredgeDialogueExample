# DREDGE Dialogue Mod Example (Now API)

This mod is necessary to add and modify dialogues with your mods.

To add a custom node, create a `.yarn` file in your `Assets/Dialogues/` directory.
For syntax refer to [YarnSpinner *Get Started*](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/getting-started/writing-in-yarn).
